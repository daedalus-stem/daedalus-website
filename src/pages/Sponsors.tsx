              As a first-year team, we are aiming to start this journey with the
              best chance possible for success. Starting from scratch, our team
              has a great opportunity to innovate, collaborate and build new
              partnerships. This is just the beginning, and we are sure that our
              teamâ€™s commitment and dedication will make this a journey one to
              remember.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are looking to partner with businesses and brands to benefit
              both parties and assist funding in our STEM Racing Journey.
            </p>
